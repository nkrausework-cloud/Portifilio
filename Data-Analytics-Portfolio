# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I’m Nicolas Krause 👋  
I’m a data analyst skilled in **Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI**.  
This portfolio showcases my projects, where I clean, analyze, and visualize data to generate insights that drive decisions.  

-----------------------
## 🔹 Projects
-----------------------
🔹Project 1: Sales Performance Dashboard

**Goal:** Build an interactive dashboard to help business leaders track revenue, top products, and regional sales.

### 🔧 Tools
- SQL (data cleaning & aggregation)
- Tableau or Power BI (dashboard)
- Excel (initial analysis)

### 📊 Process
1. Extracted sales transaction data.
2. Cleaned missing values and standardized categories.
3. Aggregated revenue by region, category, and time period.
4. Built an interactive Tableau/Power BI dashboard.

### 🚀 Insights
- Identified top 3 product categories driving 60% of revenue.
- Found underperforming regions that missed sales targets.

### 📂 Outputs

🔹Project 2: Customer Segmentation

**Goal:** Segment customers to tailor marketing campaigns and improve retention.

### 🔧 Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Process
1. Collected and cleaned customer purchase history.
2. Engineered features (frequency, recency, monetary value).
3. Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
4. Clustered customers using K-means.

### 🚀 Insights
- Found 4 distinct customer segments (e.g., "high spend loyalists", "one-time buyers").
- Insights used for targeted campaigns that boosted pilot conversions.

### 📂 Outputs
- `notebooks/segmentation.ipynb`
- `docs/clusters_visualization.png`


------------------------
🔹Project 3: Churn Prediction Model

**Goal:** Predict which customers are likely to churn so retention strategies can be targeted.

### 🔧 Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL (data extraction)

### 📊 Process
1. Balanced the dataset (SMOTE for class imbalance).
2. Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
3. Evaluated with ROC-AUC, precision/recall, confusion matrix.
4. Exported model for scoring new data.

### 🚀 Insights
- Top churn predictors: usage decline, recent support tickets, payment failures.
- Model achieved 82% ROC-AUC.

### 📂 Outputs
- `notebooks/churn_model.ipynb`
- `docs/roc_curve.png`
